Of course he's also caring, humble and discreet, but those are often overshadowed by tendencies of being deceitful as well. His wit though, this is what he is so well-liked for. Friends usually count on this and his heroic nature especially when they need comforting or support.</p><p>Nobody's perfect of course, so he has rotten moods and days too. His thievish nature and difficult nature sour the mood many a time and reach all around.</p><p>Fortunately his courtesy helps make sure these days are few and far between.</p>"},
